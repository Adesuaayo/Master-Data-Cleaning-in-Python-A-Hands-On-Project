## Introduction

Data cleaning involves fixing errors, removing inconsistencies, and preparing data for analysis. Clean data is essential for drawing reliable insights and making informed decisions. In this project, we'll use Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to clean a dataset of job listings scraped from indeed.com.

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Real-world job listings from indeed.com
- **Format**: CSV (Comma Separated Values)
- **Columns**: Title, Company, Location, Salary, Job Type, Date Posted, Summary
- **Size**: 203 rows Ã— 7 columns
- **Data Types**: Mostly string (object), requires conversion for analysis
- **Missing Values**: Found in columns like Salary, Company, and Job Type

## Tasks for Data Cleaning

1. **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and address missing values in critical columns.
2. **Extract Numeric Values from Salary**: Clean up the Salary column by removing symbols, whitespace, and non-numeric characters.
3. **Replace Inconsistent Values in Job Type**: Standardize values for smoother analysis.
4. **Parse Date Posted**: Convert the Date Posted column to a proper date format.
5. **Standardize Summary Column**: Remove special characters and non-letter characters from the Summary column.

## Key Findings

- Missing values identified in Salary, Company, and Job Type columns.
- Inconsistent formatting observed in the Job Type column.
- Date Posted column requires parsing for proper date format.

## Results of Data Cleaning

- Missing values handled using appropriate strategies.
- Salary column cleaned and converted to numeric format.
- Job Type values standardized for consistency.
- Date Posted column parsed to proper date format.
- Summary column cleaned of special characters for easier analysis.

## Conclusion

Data cleaning is an essential step in the data analysis process, ensuring reliable insights and accurate conclusions. With our dataset now clean and polished, we're ready to move on to exploratory data analysis in the next project. Stay tuned for more insights and discoveries!
